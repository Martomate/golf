# Golf with Friends

This is a remake of the game "Golf With Your Friends", which is a minigolf game with lots of unusual features. It was written during the 7 days of [Codecation](https://codecation.se/) 2023, which was a hackathon/vacation organised by Backtick Technologies in november 2023 in MÃ¡laga.

The game was written in Rust using the Bevy game engine and the Rapier3d physics library. The experience was generally good, but the collision system was a bit unstable at times which meant that about half of the hackathon was spent making collision shapes work as intended. That will likly improve in the future when the Bevy ecossystem grows and matures.
